There are generally two directions to tackle this task. 

The main strategy is image comparison in an unsupervised or semi-supervised fashion. 
First, we could extract image features (e.g. SIFT) from both images and build a classifier based 
on how many (ratio) keypoints in Image A have matching scores below the threshold. 

Another interesting idea is to modify the concept of optical flow [1]. 
The assumption is that for those objects which are absent in image B, we can not recover a proper displacement 
or the displacement contrasts with that of all the other objects (so you probably need to apply segmentation
[2] to separate different 'items'). Thus you can have a classifier using displacement measurement.

Moreover, it can be useful to apply some kind of smoothing (e.g. Gaussian) on the grey scale channel or RGB 
channels for SET 2. But I don't have an exact solution at the moment.
